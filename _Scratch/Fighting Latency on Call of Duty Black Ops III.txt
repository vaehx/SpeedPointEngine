Talk: "Fighting Latency on Call of Duty: Black Ops III" - Benjamin Goyette



- Server is authoritive
- Server periodically sends SNAPSHOT to clients
	- contains (displayed?) world state at one frame
	- Delta compression against last snapshot, the client acknowledged
	- fit into MTU of one UDP
	- snapshots/sec < frames/sec (!!!---> more frames than snapshots)
	- client interpolates between snapshots
- Clients send COMMAND packets
	- Intention of the player: jumping, shooting, ...
	- very small, UDP
	- care about reliability:
		- spam socket with commands until server acknowledges

Client side prediction:
	- On command: Client predicts result to display immediately on screen
	- next snapshot "kinda" confirms prediction
	- misprediction possible

Improving HIT DETECTION:
	- Server has buffer of latest snapshots it sent to client
	- On COMMAND packet (contains frame #): Interpolate between nearest snapshots to that frame
