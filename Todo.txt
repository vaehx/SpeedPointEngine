Product Backlog:
- HDR
- Deferred Rendering


Tasks:

#0001 - overwrite cpp assert macro
#0002 - Prevent unnecessary calls when shader does not change:
		- IASetInputLayout()
		- IASetVertexBuffer()
		- IASetIndexBuffer()
		- VSSetShader()
#0003 - Create the OutputPlane with 2 Triangles only to be able to apply screenspace effects like DOF, HDR, Lens Flares, ...
#0004 - Rewrite RenderTarget -> Viewport Pipeline

            === HOW TO PASS LIGHT SOURCES TO FORWARD SHADER? ===
                #1: use uniform array of abstract light sources
                                                                      
	
#0005 - Render to the speedpoint render target
#0006 - Render SpeedPoint Render target using a new post-fx effect and the OutputPlane as geometry to render the SPRT to
  	the backbuffer. Then present / swap.
#0007 - Tonemapping in post-fx
#0008 - Create Direct2D Rendertarget / surface, render text on it
#0009 - Render Direct2D Rendertarget (pConsoleD2DSurface) to the SPRT
#0010 - Implement SCamera::RecalculateMatrix() for roll = true

#0011 - Unify geometry load structs
#0012 - Add bumpmap type:
	enum EBumpmapType
	{
		BUMPMAP_TYPE_NORMALS,
		BUMPMAP_TYPE_INTENSITY		
	};
#0013 - Add bumpmap blur factor

#0014 - Create IPlayer struct:
    - Should be as flexible as possible
    - Composition of camera, pass pointer of this camera to the viewport when setting player.
        void SpeedPointEngine::SetPlayer(IPlayer* pPlayer)
        {
            m_pTargetViewport->SetCamera(pPlayer->GetCamera());
        }
    - implementation may use different cameras and custom camera transformations. This is allows not only FPS Games, but also space shooters, etc...
    - implementation should be in game application rather than in engine
    - Aggregation to Player geometry (ICharacterObject*).
        - Set to 0 if not used
        - move with camera        
            #### ?????  How to take scripting of the player into account  ??????? ######                               

#0015 - create Class FirstPersonPlayer, implementing IPlayer:
    - "Selection" of focused object. Example: standing in front of a door, then "Press (F) to open" should be displayed
        1) Get objects in Focus-Bounding Sphere around player
        2) Ray Cast a ray in the view direction with length of the focus bounding sphere radius, Intersect with BoundBox of object
        3) Take first intersecting object as the one selected.
        4) Raise further events
        
#0016 - Store face information in Geometry
#0017 - <<Geometry>>::Invalidate() -> flag that hw buffers to be updated
        In <<DynamicsPipeline>>::Run(), after all calculations, check for objects invalidated and upload those vertex datas
        
#0018 - Use TerrainQuadtree Draft in Engine

#0019 - U S E    C H U N K P O O L    F O R    R E N D E R S C H E D U L E
        - Then, avoid RenderGeometry() and RenderTerrain().
          Instead, create and use GetRenderScheduleSlot() and GetTerrainRenderDesc().
          This allows a static Render schedule.
        - Encapsulate into SRenderScheduleSlot:
            struct SRenderScheduleSlot {
                SRenderDesc renderDesc;
            };
            typedef struct         
        - Requires function ReleaseRenderScheduleSlot()
          
#0020 - Use list of free slots in ChunkPool Chunks. List has fixed size. List is a Queue.
    When trying to find an empty slot, this list avoids looping through (worst-case) all slots until something found.
