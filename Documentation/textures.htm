<h1>Textures</h1>

<h2>Texture management</h2>

<p>Textures are managed in an object pool. Each texture object is identified by its specification.</p>
<p>When you call <code>ResourcePool::GetTexture(specification)</code> it will always return a valid pointer to an existing object with the given specification.<br />
If there was no texture object with the given specification yet, the resource pool will attempt to load the texture from disk. This may not happen immediately, but
the texture will be streamed in a separate thread.<br />
You cannot modify textures retrieved by <code>GetTexture()</code>.</p>
<p>To create a new empty Texture that can be modified, you can use <code>ResourcePool::AddTexture()</code></p>
